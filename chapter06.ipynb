Once you start working in the community, you are not only required to solve the problem of your clients or others, but also to spot or suggest a potential issue which even the client doesn’t notice. When you write a bachelor/master thesis, you also need to explore the unsolved problems by yourself, address them by all possible means to search for a solution, and give your findings back to the society. Through your research, you can acquire abilities to establish your specialty as if building your castle, to complete theories/works, and to appeal to others, which would be useful anywhere in the society. There is always someone who has been conducting a related study in the world. Whenever you advance your research, you will face challenges from the world. For this reason, even when you write a bachelor/master thesis, you should set the research topic bearing in mind the need to present the findings of your research in international conferences or journals.
